# Number Guessing Game

## Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive web application where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess, giving hints whether the guess is too low or too high. Players can also keep track of their scores, with a leaderboard displaying their top results.
